<p>Bottle is a lightweight python web framework.</p>
<p>The python web framework is mainly divided into heavyweight frameworks and lightweight frameworks.</p>
<p>Heavyweight frameworks (such as django) have a high entry barrier, and then there are more development constraints.</p>
<p>Lightweight frameworks (such as bottle) are flexible in development and easy to get started, but many components need to be developed by themselves.</p>
